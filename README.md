# Financial News Sentiment Classification with Fine-tuned BERT Model
## Overview
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of financial news text using a fine-tuned BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) model from Hugging Face. The objective is to classify financial news articles into different sentiment categories, such as positive, negative, or neutral. The project includes the integration of a confusion matrix to visualize the model's accuracy and a word cloud to highlight key terms within the dataset.

## Model
The core of this project is a fine-tuned BERT model designed to understand the nuances of financial news sentiment. The model leverages the Hugging Face Transformers library, providing state-of-the-art pre-trained language models for natural language processing tasks.
